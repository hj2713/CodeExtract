  "prompt": "You are extracting a code example from a source codebase into an isolated, runnable Next.js page.\n\n## Source\n\n**Path:** src/source\n**Analysis:** \nthis was cloned from github. this is a landing page\n\n## Target Directory\n\n**Path:** src/app/extracted\n\nIt contains the following files -- first you should read it. \nTHIS IS YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY\nYOU MUST DO YOUR BEST TO NOT CREATE MANY FOLDERS OR FILES OUTSIDE OF THIS DIRECTORY!\n\n- page.tsx — Next.js page demonstrating the requirement\n- actions.ts — Server actions or API calls (if needed)\n- types.ts — All TypeScript types/interfaces\n- utils.ts — Helper functions, fixtures, mocks\n- README.md — Explanation of the example\n\n## Requirement\n\nExtract and isolate: Recreate the Account Dashboard Card component as closely as possible to the design presented in the ANALYSIS.md document, prioritizing accurate replication of the visual elements, layout, and interactive behavior. The component should function correctly for a standard laptop screen size, without requiring full responsiveness for smaller devices. The component will display static data, but the 'Activity' section's tabs ('Payments', 'Collected fees', 'Transfers', and 'Payouts') must be functional, each presenting a different set of static transaction data. The transaction table includes the columns: 'Transaction Amount', 'Status', 'Account Details', and 'Date'. Implement basic filtering based on the active tab. Implement a 'Pay Out' button.  Include a 'Succeeded' status in green for transactions; other transaction statuses (e.g., 'Pending', 'Failed') should not be included. No additional sorting or filtering options are required beyond the tab-based filtering and the columns displayed in the image. Mimic the visual styling (colors, typography, spacing, shadows, borders) as described in the analysis document using Tailwind CSS. Focus on achieving a pixel-perfect representation of the design for laptop screens, but responsiveness for other screen sizes is explicitly excluded. Data should be passed as props to the React component. Error handling and loading states are not explicitly required, but the component should not crash or exhibit unexpected behavior if data is missing or invalid. The component should be accessible, including appropriate ARIA labels and keyboard navigation for interactive elements.\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThe user requires an account dashboard card component that closely resembles a given visual design. This component will be integrated into a larger project, likely a financial dashboard or management interface. The primary use case is to provide users with a clear and concise overview of their account's financial status and activity. The component should present key financial metrics, recent transaction history, and a call-to-action button, all within a visually appealing and user-friendly card layout. The user intends to use this card in future projects.\n\n## Dependency Handling\n\nAs you extract, you will encounter dependencies. Handle them as follows:\n\n**NPM packages:**\nIf genuinely required, include them and note in README. If only used for one small thing, consider inlining the logic instead.\n\n**Internal code from source repo:**\n- If portable (small, self-contained utility/type/hook): Copy it over with a comment noting origin (e.g., `// Ported from: src/utils/shapes.ts`)\n- If not portable (deeply entangled): Mock it with hardcoded values or fixture data\n- In both cases, do these in a seperate folder/file inside the working dir (\"extracted\")\n\n**Databases / APIs / Auth / External services:**\nAlways mock. Use hardcoded fixture data. Never require actual infrastructure.\nExample: Instead of database query, use `const MOCK_DATA = [...]`\nExample: Instead of auth, use `const CURRENT_USER = { id: \"user_1\", name: \"Demo User\" }`\n\n**State management:**\nSimplify to React useState/useReducer unless state management IS the pattern being extracted.\n\n## Output Requirements\n\nThe code example must be:\n1. **Runnable** — Works in a Next.js 14 app (app router)\n2. **Isolated** — No imports from source codebase\n3. **Minimal** — Only code necessary to demonstrate the requirement\n4. **Clear** — A developer understands the pattern in <5 minutes\n\n## README.md Must Include\n\n# [Requirement Title]\n\n## What this demonstrates\n[One paragraph explanation]\n\n## Original implementation\n[Brief description of how source repo did it]\n\nKey files from source:\n- [file path] — [what it did]\n- [file path] — [what it did]\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### NPM packages required\n- [package] — [why needed]\n\n### Code ported from source\n- [util name] from [original path] — [description]\n\n### Mocked in this example\n- [what was mocked] — [how it was mocked]\n\n## How to use\n[Any setup or usage instructions]\n\n---\n\nExecute: Analyze the source, extract relevant code, handle dependencies as encountered, produce the code example.",
