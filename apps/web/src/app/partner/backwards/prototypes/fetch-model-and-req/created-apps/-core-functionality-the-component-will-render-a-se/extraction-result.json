  "prompt": "You are extracting a code example from a source codebase into an isolated, runnable Next.js page.\n\n## Source\n\n**Path:** src/source\n**Analysis:** \nthis was cloned from github. this is a landing page\n\n## Target Directory\n\n**Path:** src/app/extracted\n\nIt contains the following files -- first you should read it. \nTHIS IS YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY\nYOU MUST DO YOUR BEST TO NOT CREATE MANY FOLDERS OR FILES OUTSIDE OF THIS DIRECTORY!\n\n- page.tsx — Next.js page demonstrating the requirement\n- actions.ts — Server actions or API calls (if needed)\n- types.ts — All TypeScript types/interfaces\n- utils.ts — Helper functions, fixtures, mocks\n- README.md — Explanation of the example\n\n## Requirement\n\nExtract and isolate: ## Core Functionality\n- The component will render a section of a website displaying starter packs for a hackathon.\n- The section will include navigation links for 'About', 'Itinerary', 'Starter Packs', 'FAQ', and 'Sponsors'. These links will be static and do not require dynamic routing.\n- The section will display starter pack cards. These cards should have a hover effect to visually indicate interactivity. When a card is clicked, it should navigate to a placeholder URL.\n- The section will include a placeholder image for the MLH official season logo. This logo will not be a link.\n- The component must be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.\n\n## Technical Implementation Details\n- **Architecture:** React functional component using `styled-components` for styling.\n- **State Management:** No explicit state management is required as the content is static.  If interactivity is needed in the future, consider `useState` hook.\n- **Component Structure:**\n  - A main container element to hold the entire section.\n  - A navigation component to render the navigation links.\n  - A container for the starter pack cards.\n  - Individual card components for each starter pack.\n  - An image component for the MLH logo.\n- **Styling:**\n  - Use `styled-components` to define the styles.\n  - Adhere to the color palette, typography, spacing, borders, and shadows as defined in the design specifications (Primary: #FFFFFF, Secondary: #800080, Background: #B2C4F3, Text: #000000, Accent: #FFD700; Font Family: sans-serif; Heading: 32px / 700; Body: 16px / 400; Padding: 20px; Margin: 0; Gap: 10px; Radius: 5px; Border Color: #CCCCCC; Border Width: 1px; Shadow: `0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`).\n  - Implement responsive styling using media queries within the `styled-components` to handle different screen sizes.\n- **Data Models:**\n  - The navigation links can be hardcoded as an array of objects with `label` and `url` properties. The `url` will be a placeholder for now.\n  - Similarly, the starter pack card data will be hardcoded with `title`, `imageSrc`, and `link` properties. The `link` will be a placeholder URL.\n- **Algorithms/Logic:**\n  - Hover effect on the cards can be achieved using styled-components pseudo-selectors (`:hover`).\n  - The component must conditionally render based on screen size for responsiveness.\n  - The `map` function will be used to iterate over the navigation links and starter pack data to render the components.\n\n## UI/UX Specifications\n- **Component Hierarchy:**\n  - `SectionContainer` (styled.section)\n    - `Navigation` (React component)\n      - `NavLink` (styled.a, repeated for each link)\n    - `StarterPacksContainer` (styled.div)\n      - `StarterPackCard` (React component, repeated for each card)\n        - `CardImage` (styled.img)\n        - `CardTitle` (styled.h3)\n    - `MLHLogo` (styled.img)\n- **Styling:** styled-components with the specified color palette, typography, spacing, borders, and shadows.\n- **Responsive Behavior:**\n  - Mobile: Cards stack vertically, navigation links remain as is.\n  - Desktop: Layout as per the provided image. The goal is to closely match the look and feel of the reference image.\n  - Tablet: Adapt the desktop layout to fit the screen. This might involve adjusting margins, padding, and font sizes.\n- **User Feedback:**\n  - Hover effect on cards to indicate interactivity.\n  - No explicit loading or error states are required since the data is static.\n\n## Integration Points\n- The component will receive no props. Navigation links and starter pack card data are hardcoded.\n- No events are emitted.\n\n## Edge Cases & Error Handling\n- No specific error handling is needed as the data is static. The component should render gracefully even if the images fail to load (using alt text).\n- Placeholder URLs should be valid URLs (e.g., '#')\n\n## What to EXCLUDE\n- No animations or transitions are required.\n- No dynamic data fetching is required.\n- No hamburger menu for navigation on mobile is required; the links stay as they are.\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThe user is building a website for a hackathon and needs a section to display available starter packs. This section includes navigation links, starter pack cards, and the MLH logo. It's a static section with placeholder data.\n\n## Dependency Handling\n\nAs you extract, you will encounter dependencies. Handle them as follows:\n\n**NPM packages:**\nIf genuinely required, include them and note in README. If only used for one small thing, consider inlining the logic instead.\n\n**Internal code from source repo:**\n- If portable (small, self-contained utility/type/hook): Copy it over with a comment noting origin (e.g., `// Ported from: src/utils/shapes.ts`)\n- If not portable (deeply entangled): Mock it with hardcoded values or fixture data\n- In both cases, do these in a seperate folder/file inside the working dir (\"extracted\")\n\n**Databases / APIs / Auth / External services:**\nAlways mock. Use hardcoded fixture data. Never require actual infrastructure.\nExample: Instead of database query, use `const MOCK_DATA = [...]`\nExample: Instead of auth, use `const CURRENT_USER = { id: \"user_1\", name: \"Demo User\" }`\n\n**State management:**\nSimplify to React useState/useReducer unless state management IS the pattern being extracted.\n\n## Output Requirements\n\nThe code example must be:\n1. **Runnable** — Works in a Next.js 14 app (app router)\n2. **Isolated** — No imports from source codebase\n3. **Minimal** — Only code necessary to demonstrate the requirement\n4. **Clear** — A developer understands the pattern in <5 minutes\n\n## README.md Must Include\n\n# [Requirement Title]\n\n## What this demonstrates\n[One paragraph explanation]\n\n## Original implementation\n[Brief description of how source repo did it]\n\nKey files from source:\n- [file path] — [what it did]\n- [file path] — [what it did]\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### NPM packages required\n- [package] — [why needed]\n\n### Code ported from source\n- [util name] from [original path] — [description]\n\n### Mocked in this example\n- [what was mocked] — [how it was mocked]\n\n## How to use\n[Any setup or usage instructions]\n\n---\n\nExecute: Analyze the source, extract relevant code, handle dependencies as encountered, produce the code example.\n",
