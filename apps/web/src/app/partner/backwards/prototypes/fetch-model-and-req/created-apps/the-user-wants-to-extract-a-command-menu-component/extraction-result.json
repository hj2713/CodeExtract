  "prompt": "You are extracting a code example from a source codebase into an isolated, runnable Next.js page.\n\n## Source\n\n**Path:** src/source\n**Analysis:** \nthis was cloned from github. this is a landing page\n\n## Target Directory\n\n**Path:** src/app/extracted\n\nIt contains the following files -- first you should read it. \nTHIS IS YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY\nYOU MUST DO YOUR BEST TO NOT CREATE MANY FOLDERS OR FILES OUTSIDE OF THIS DIRECTORY!\n\n- page.tsx — Next.js page demonstrating the requirement\n- actions.ts — Server actions or API calls (if needed)\n- types.ts — All TypeScript types/interfaces\n- utils.ts — Helper functions, fixtures, mocks\n- README.md — Explanation of the example\n\n## Requirement\n\nExtract and isolate: The user wants to extract a Command Menu component, including keyboard navigation and associated styling, from the provided code repository. The component should be extracted exactly as it exists in the repository. The specific location of the component is believed to be within the `apps/v4/app/` directory and its subdirectories, particularly under the `(app)` route group.  The AI should understand the component's functionality and structure by analyzing the code in the specified directories, looking for files related to search, filtering, navigation, keyboard shortcuts, and menus. The AI should also identify the UI elements and libraries used by the Command Menu, such as Button, Input, List, and search/keyboard navigation libraries. The extracted component must include:\n\n## Core Functionality\n- Display a list of commands or options.\n- Allow users to search or filter the commands.\n- Enable navigation through the command list using the keyboard (arrow keys, Enter, Esc).\n- Execute a command when selected.\n- Open via a keyboard shortcut or button click\n\n## Technical Implementation Details\n- The architecture of the command menu isn't determined, but the extraction process should preserve whatever structure exists. It could be a single component or a composition of multiple components.\n- The state management approach is also undetermined, but the extracted component should maintain its existing state management logic.\n- Key algorithms include search/filtering logic (fuzzy search is possible), and keyboard navigation handling.\n- No new API endpoints are expected; the component should work with existing data or potentially need data models described below if API calls are present.\n\n## UI/UX Specifications\n- The command menu could appear as a dropdown, a modal, or some other type of UI element.\n- The styling should be extracted along with the component, using whatever styling approach is employed in the repository (Tailwind CSS is likely).\n- The component should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.\n- The implementation of animations or transitions should be extracted as-is.\n\n## Integration Points\n- The command menu should integrate with the rest of the application seamlessly, potentially emitting events or calling functions when commands are executed. The extraction process should ensure these integration points are preserved.\n- The precise props interface depends on the component's implementation, but it might include props for setting the available commands, customizing the appearance, or handling events.\n\n## Edge Cases & Error Handling\n- The extracted component should handle edge cases gracefully, such as when no commands are available or when a search returns no results.\n- Validation requirements will depend on the component's input, but should be extracted as-is. Error handling will also depend on existing implementation.\n- The extraction should preserve existing error handling and fallback behaviors.\n\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThe user wants to extract a pre-existing Command Menu component from the shadcn/ui repository to reuse in their own project. This will save them time and effort compared to building a command menu from scratch. It is intended to add a command palette style interface into a new project, which is similar to the existing component.\n\n## Dependency Handling\n\nAs you extract, you will encounter dependencies. Handle them as follows:\n\n**NPM packages:**\nIf genuinely required, include them and note in README. If only used for one small thing, consider inlining the logic instead.\n\n**Internal code from source repo:**\n- If portable (small, self-contained utility/type/hook): Copy it over with a comment noting origin (e.g., `// Ported from: src/utils/shapes.ts`)\n- If not portable (deeply entangled): Mock it with hardcoded values or fixture data\n- In both cases, do these in a seperate folder/file inside the working dir (\"extracted\")\n\n**Databases / APIs / Auth / External services:**\nAlways mock. Use hardcoded fixture data. Never require actual infrastructure.\nExample: Instead of database query, use `const MOCK_DATA = [...]`\nExample: Instead of auth, use `const CURRENT_USER = { id: \"user_1\", name: \"Demo User\" }`\n\n**State management:**\nSimplify to React useState/useReducer unless state management IS the pattern being extracted.\n\n## Output Requirements\n\nThe code example must be:\n1. **Runnable** — Works in a Next.js 14 app (app router)\n2. **Isolated** — No imports from source codebase\n3. **Minimal** — Only code necessary to demonstrate the requirement\n4. **Clear** — A developer understands the pattern in <5 minutes\n\n## README.md Must Include\n\n# [Requirement Title]\n\n## What this demonstrates\n[One paragraph explanation]\n\n## Original implementation\n[Brief description of how source repo did it]\n\nKey files from source:\n- [file path] — [what it did]\n- [file path] — [what it did]\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### NPM packages required\n- [package] — [why needed]\n\n### Code ported from source\n- [util name] from [original path] — [description]\n\n### Mocked in this example\n- [what was mocked] — [how it was mocked]\n\n## How to use\n[Any setup or usage instructions]\n\n---\n\nExecute: Analyze the source, extract relevant code, handle dependencies as encountered, produce the code example.",
