  "prompt": "You are extracting a code example from a source codebase into an isolated, runnable Next.js page.\n\n## Source\n\n**Path:** src/source\n**Analysis:** \nthis was cloned from github. this is a landing page\n\n## Target Directory\n\n**Path:** src/app/extracted\n\nIt contains the following files -- first you should read it. \nTHIS IS YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY\nYOU MUST DO YOUR BEST TO NOT CREATE MANY FOLDERS OR FILES OUTSIDE OF THIS DIRECTORY!\n\n- page.tsx — Next.js page demonstrating the requirement\n- actions.ts — Server actions or API calls (if needed)\n- types.ts — All TypeScript types/interfaces\n- utils.ts — Helper functions, fixtures, mocks\n- README.md — Explanation of the example\n\n## Requirement\n\nExtract and isolate: DETAILED TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION:\n\n## Core Functionality\n- Implement a React component that visually replicates the 'Hero Section with Starter Packs' design from the screenshot, but repurposed to showcase personal projects for a resume.\n- Each card represents a project and includes a title, description, placeholder image, and a clickable link to the project's code or live demo.\n- On clicking a card, the user should be navigated to the project's URL.\n- The component must support a variable number of project cards.\n\n## Technical Implementation Details\n- Architecture: React component using a functional component structure with hooks (likely useState for managing component-level state, if needed).\n- Styling: Tailwind CSS for styling the component and ensuring responsiveness.\n- Data Handling: The component will initially use static data for the project cards. Define a data structure (array of objects) to hold project information. The component must be designed to accommodate dynamic data (fetched from an API or data file) in the future without significant code changes.\n- Image Handling: Use `picsum.photos` to generate placeholder images for the project cards.\n\n### Data Model (TypeScript):\n```typescript\ninterface Project {\n  title: string;\n  description: string;\n  imageUrl: string; // From picsum.photos\n  link: string;\n}\n```\n- API Endpoints: No API endpoints are required initially, as the data is static.\n- State Management: useState hook will be utilized to store the project data.\n\n```typescript\nconst [projects, setProjects] = useState<Project[]>([\n  {\n    title: 'Project 1',\n    description: 'Description of Project 1...', \n    imageUrl: 'https://picsum.photos/200/300',\n    link: 'https://example.com/project1'\n  },\n  // ... more projects\n]);\n```\n\n## UI/UX Specifications\n- Component Hierarchy:\n  - `HeroSection` (main component)\n    - `Navigation` (navigation bar at the top. Placeholder only, no actual links)\n    - `CardStackContainer` (container for the project cards)\n      - `ProjectCard` (individual project card component)\n- Styling: Tailwind CSS will be used to match the design in the screenshot.\n- Responsive Behavior:\n  - Desktop/Laptop: The cards should be displayed in a horizontal layout (mimicking the card stack).\n  - Mobile: The cards should stack vertically in a single column.\n- Animations/Transitions:\n  - Hover Effect: When hovering over a card, it should lift slightly with a subtle shadow increase.\n- User Feedback:\n  - No specific loading or error states are required initially, given the static data. However, consider adding a loading indicator for future dynamic data fetching.\n\n## Integration Points\n- Props Interface (TypeScript):\n```typescript\ninterface HeroSectionProps {\n  projects: Project[];\n}\n```\n- No events are emitted.\n\n## Edge Cases & Error Handling\n- Long Text: Ensure that long project titles and descriptions wrap correctly within the card layout without overflowing.\n- Missing Images: The `picsum.photos` service should provide fallback images if a specific image fails to load. Implement error handling for image loading.\n\n## Accessibility\n- Color Contrast: Ensure that the text color on the cards meets accessibility guidelines for color contrast ratios.\n- Keyboard Navigation: Ensure that the cards are focusable and navigable using the keyboard. Use `tabIndex` and ARIA attributes appropriately.\n\n## What to EXCLUDE\n- Focus and pressed states on the cards are not required for now.\n- No need for complex animations or transitions beyond the specified hover effect.\n\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThe user is building a personal resume website and wants to use a hero section with project cards to showcase their projects. The visual design should match a provided screenshot, and the component should be responsive, accessible, and support a variable number of cards.\n\n## Dependency Handling\n\nAs you extract, you will encounter dependencies. Handle them as follows:\n\n**NPM packages:**\nIf genuinely required, include them and note in README. If only used for one small thing, consider inlining the logic instead.\n\n**Internal code from source repo:**\n- If portable (small, self-contained utility/type/hook): Copy it over with a comment noting origin (e.g., `// Ported from: src/utils/shapes.ts`)\n- If not portable (deeply entangled): Mock it with hardcoded values or fixture data\n- In both cases, do these in a seperate folder/file inside the working dir (\"extracted\")\n\n**Databases / APIs / Auth / External services:**\nAlways mock. Use hardcoded fixture data. Never require actual infrastructure.\nExample: Instead of database query, use `const MOCK_DATA = [...]`\nExample: Instead of auth, use `const CURRENT_USER = { id: \"user_1\", name: \"Demo User\" }`\n\n**State management:**\nSimplify to React useState/useReducer unless state management IS the pattern being extracted.\n\n## Output Requirements\n\nThe code example must be:\n1. **Runnable** — Works in a Next.js 14 app (app router)\n2. **Isolated** — No imports from source codebase\n3. **Minimal** — Only code necessary to demonstrate the requirement\n4. **Clear** — A developer understands the pattern in <5 minutes\n\n## README.md Must Include\n\n# [Requirement Title]\n\n## What this demonstrates\n[One paragraph explanation]\n\n## Original implementation\n[Brief description of how source repo did it]\n\nKey files from source:\n- [file path] — [what it did]\n- [file path] — [what it did]\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### NPM packages required\n- [package] — [why needed]\n\n### Code ported from source\n- [util name] from [original path] — [description]\n\n### Mocked in this example\n- [what was mocked] — [how it was mocked]\n\n## How to use\n[Any setup or usage instructions]\n\n---\n\nExecute: Analyze the source, extract relevant code, handle dependencies as encountered, produce the code example.\n",
