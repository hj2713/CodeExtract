  "prompt": "You are extracting a code example from a source codebase into an isolated, runnable Next.js page.\n\n## Source\n\n**Path:** src/source\n**Analysis:** \nthis was cloned from github. this is a landing page\n\n## Target Directory\n\n**Path:** src/app/extracted\n\nIt contains the following files -- first you should read it. \nTHIS IS YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY\nYOU MUST DO YOUR BEST TO NOT CREATE MANY FOLDERS OR FILES OUTSIDE OF THIS DIRECTORY!\n\n- page.tsx — Next.js page demonstrating the requirement\n- actions.ts — Server actions or API calls (if needed)\n- types.ts — All TypeScript types/interfaces\n- utils.ts — Helper functions, fixtures, mocks\n- README.md — Explanation of the example\n\n## Requirement\n\nExtract and isolate: Extract the email tracking functionality from MailSuite for use in a social media application, focusing on pixel-based tracking. The extraction should include: the UI components for the analytics dashboard with existing CSS styling, the data logic for the analytics, replacing Supabase with a simpler data storage solution (e.g., JSON file), and a basic Node.js/Express API endpoint for generating the tracking pixel. Subscription tiers, notifications, the Chrome extension, and authentication should be excluded. The extracted component needs to be able to track when messages are opened and provide UI to display this data.\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThe user wants to integrate email tracking functionality into their social media application to track when messages are viewed. They plan to use the extracted component separately via an API, keeping it decoupled from their main project.\n\n## Dependency Handling\n\nAs you extract, you will encounter dependencies. Handle them as follows:\n\n**NPM packages:**\nIf genuinely required, include them and note in README. If only used for one small thing, consider inlining the logic instead.\n\n**Internal code from source repo:**\n- If portable (small, self-contained utility/type/hook): Copy it over with a comment noting origin (e.g., `// Ported from: src/utils/shapes.ts`)\n- If not portable (deeply entangled): Mock it with hardcoded values or fixture data\n- In both cases, do these in a seperate folder/file inside the working dir (\"extracted\")\n\n**Databases / APIs / Auth / External services:**\nAlways mock. Use hardcoded fixture data. Never require actual infrastructure.\nExample: Instead of database query, use `const MOCK_DATA = [...]`\nExample: Instead of auth, use `const CURRENT_USER = { id: \"user_1\", name: \"Demo User\" }`\n\n**State management:**\nSimplify to React useState/useReducer unless state management IS the pattern being extracted.\n\n## Output Requirements\n\nThe code example must be:\n1. **Runnable** — Works in a Next.js 14 app (app router)\n2. **Isolated** — No imports from source codebase\n3. **Minimal** — Only code necessary to demonstrate the requirement\n4. **Clear** — A developer understands the pattern in <5 minutes\n\n## README.md Must Include\n\n# [Requirement Title]\n\n## What this demonstrates\n[One paragraph explanation]\n\n## Original implementation\n[Brief description of how source repo did it]\n\nKey files from source:\n- [file path] — [what it did]\n- [file path] — [what it did]\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### NPM packages required\n- [package] — [why needed]\n\n### Code ported from source\n- [util name] from [original path] — [description]\n\n### Mocked in this example\n- [what was mocked] — [how it was mocked]\n\n## How to use\n[Any setup or usage instructions]\n\n---\n\nExecute: Analyze the source, extract relevant code, handle dependencies as encountered, produce the code example.\n",
