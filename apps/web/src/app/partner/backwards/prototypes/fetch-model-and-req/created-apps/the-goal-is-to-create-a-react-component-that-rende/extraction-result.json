  "prompt": "You are extracting a code example from a source codebase into an isolated, runnable Next.js page.\n\n## Source\n\n**Path:** src/source\n**Analysis:** \nthis was cloned from github. this is a landing page\n\n## Target Directory\n\n**Path:** src/app/extracted\n\nIt contains the following files -- first you should read it. \nTHIS IS YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY\nYOU MUST DO YOUR BEST TO NOT CREATE MANY FOLDERS OR FILES OUTSIDE OF THIS DIRECTORY!\n\n- page.tsx — Next.js page demonstrating the requirement\n- actions.ts — Server actions or API calls (if needed)\n- types.ts — All TypeScript types/interfaces\n- utils.ts — Helper functions, fixtures, mocks\n- README.md — Explanation of the example\n\n## Requirement\n\nExtract and isolate: The goal is to create a React component that renders a dynamically populated, sortable table displaying connected account data. The component will consist of a table with the following columns: Account name (including an avatar image), Account country, Payment balance, and Volume. The table should be styled to strictly adhere to the visual design specified in the provided document, including colors, typography, and spacing. The data for the table should be dynamically populated using a placeholder TypeScript interface:\n\n```typescript\naccountData: {\n    account: string;\n    accountCountry: string;\n    paymentBalance: number;\n    volume: number;\n    avatar: string;\n  }[]\n```\n\nThe table should initially render 3-4 rows of placeholder data. Sorting should be enabled by default on the table, with the \"Account\" column set as the default sorting column. The table rows should have a hover effect to improve user experience, using a background color change as specified in the document. On smaller screens, the table should maintain its layout and become horizontally scrollable to accommodate the content. Avatar images should be included as placeholders within the table, mimicking the appearance of the provided image. The table headers should include the following styles: `text-left`, `text-gray-500`, `text-xs`. In summary, the component is a React-based data table that dynamically displays and sorts account information while adhering to specific design guidelines and responsiveness requirements. There's no need for the payment confirmation card, only the connected accounts table.\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThe user is creating a dashboard and needs a component to display connected accounts and their associated financial data. This component will allow users to view their account performance in a clear, organized, and visually appealing way. This component is for displaying account names, account countries, payment balances and volume information in a table format, with styling matching the attached document.\n\n## Dependency Handling\n\nAs you extract, you will encounter dependencies. Handle them as follows:\n\n**NPM packages:**\nIf genuinely required, include them and note in README. If only used for one small thing, consider inlining the logic instead.\n\n**Internal code from source repo:**\n- If portable (small, self-contained utility/type/hook): Copy it over with a comment noting origin (e.g., `// Ported from: src/utils/shapes.ts`)\n- If not portable (deeply entangled): Mock it with hardcoded values or fixture data\n- In both cases, do these in a seperate folder/file inside the working dir (\"extracted\")\n\n**Databases / APIs / Auth / External services:**\nAlways mock. Use hardcoded fixture data. Never require actual infrastructure.\nExample: Instead of database query, use `const MOCK_DATA = [...]`\nExample: Instead of auth, use `const CURRENT_USER = { id: \"user_1\", name: \"Demo User\" }`\n\n**State management:**\nSimplify to React useState/useReducer unless state management IS the pattern being extracted.\n\n## Output Requirements\n\nThe code example must be:\n1. **Runnable** — Works in a Next.js 14 app (app router)\n2. **Isolated** — No imports from source codebase\n3. **Minimal** — Only code necessary to demonstrate the requirement\n4. **Clear** — A developer understands the pattern in <5 minutes\n\n## README.md Must Include\n\n# [Requirement Title]\n\n## What this demonstrates\n[One paragraph explanation]\n\n## Original implementation\n[Brief description of how source repo did it]\n\nKey files from source:\n- [file path] — [what it did]\n- [file path] — [what it did]\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### NPM packages required\n- [package] — [why needed]\n\n### Code ported from source\n- [util name] from [original path] — [description]\n\n### Mocked in this example\n- [what was mocked] — [how it was mocked]\n\n## How to use\n[Any setup or usage instructions]\n\n---\n\nExecute: Analyze the source, extract relevant code, handle dependencies as encountered, produce the code example.",
