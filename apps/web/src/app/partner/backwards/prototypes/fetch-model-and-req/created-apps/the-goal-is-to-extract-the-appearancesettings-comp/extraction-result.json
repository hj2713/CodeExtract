  "prompt": "You are extracting a code example from a source codebase into an isolated, runnable Next.js page.\n\n## Source\n\n**Path:** src/source\n**Analysis:** \nthis was cloned from github. this is a landing page\n\n## Target Directory\n\n**Path:** src/app/extracted\n\nIt contains the following files -- first you should read it. \nTHIS IS YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY\nYOU MUST DO YOUR BEST TO NOT CREATE MANY FOLDERS OR FILES OUTSIDE OF THIS DIRECTORY!\n\n- page.tsx — Next.js page demonstrating the requirement\n- actions.ts — Server actions or API calls (if needed)\n- types.ts — All TypeScript types/interfaces\n- utils.ts — Helper functions, fixtures, mocks\n- README.md — Explanation of the example\n\n## Requirement\n\nExtract and isolate: The goal is to extract the `AppearanceSettings` component from the `apps/v4/app/(app)/(root)/components/appearance-settings.tsx` file within the repository. The component should be extracted with all its functionality, dependencies, and styling intact. This includes but is not limited to:\n\n## Core Functionality\n- **Configuration of appearance-related settings:** The primary function is to allow users to modify visual settings of the application, specifically compute environment and wallpaper tinting.\n- **User Interactions:** Users should be able to interact with the component via UI elements such as buttons, radio buttons, input fields, and switches to adjust settings.\n- **Data Flow:**\n  - Input: User interacts with UI elements (e.g., clicks a button, toggles a switch, enters text).\n  - Processing: The component handles these interactions by updating its internal state. The state is likely managed using `useState` or `useReducer` hooks from React.\n  - Output: The component updates the UI based on the current state. The selected settings are then presumably applied to other parts of the application, potentially using Context or local storage, though the persistence mechanism isn't defined in the original documentation and needs to be inferred from the component's actual source code.\n\n## Technical Implementation Details\n- **Architecture Pattern:** Likely a hooks-based functional component.\n- **State Management:** The component uses internal state, likely using `useState` or `useReducer` hooks.\n- **Key Algorithms/Logic Flows:**\n  - Event handlers for UI elements (e.g., `onChange` for switches, `onClick` for buttons).\n  - Logic to update the component's state based on user interactions.\n  - Logic to apply the selected settings to other parts of the application (this needs to be inferred from the source code).\n- **API Endpoints:** No API endpoints are directly used by this component.\n- **Data Models/Schemas:** No explicit data models are defined, but the component likely manages settings as key-value pairs in its internal state. The structure of this state needs to be derived from the source code. For example:\n  ```typescript\n  interface AppearanceSettingsState {\n    computeEnvironment: string;\n    wallpaperTint: string;\n    // ... other settings\n  }\n  ```\n\n## UI/UX Specifications\n- **Component Hierarchy:**\n  - `AppearanceSettings`\n    - `Button`\n    - `ButtonGroup`\n    - `Field`\n    - `Input`\n    - `RadioGroup`\n    - `RadioGroupItem`\n    - `Switch`\n    - `IconMinus`\n    - `IconPlus`\n- **Styling Approach:** Assumed to be using Tailwind CSS, given the project context. Specific styles are defined using Tailwind CSS classes.\n- **Responsive Behavior:** The component should adapt to different screen sizes. This is likely achieved using Tailwind CSS's responsive modifiers (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`).\n- **Animations/Transitions:** No specific animations or transitions are mentioned, but the component may use subtle transitions for UI elements like switches or buttons.\n- **User Feedback:** The component should provide clear visual feedback to the user when settings are changed (e.g., a loading state when applying settings).\n\n## Integration Points\n- **Connections to Other Parts of the App:** The component likely interacts with other parts of the application to apply the selected settings. This could involve updating a global state (using React Context), writing to local storage, or sending data to a server.\n- **Events Emitted/Listened To:** The component doesn't emit custom events. It relies on built-in event handlers for UI elements.\n- **Props Interface:** The component accepts no props directly, relying on its internal state for data management.\n\n## Edge Cases & Error Handling\n- **What Happens When Things Fail:** The component should handle errors gracefully. For example, if applying a setting fails, it should display an error message to the user.\n- **Validation Requirements:** The component may need to validate user input. For example, it may need to ensure that a user enters a valid value for wallpaper tinting.\n- **Fallback Behaviors:** If a setting cannot be applied, the component should revert to a default value.\n\n## What to EXCLUDE\n- Any features or functionalities not directly related to configuring appearance settings (compute environment, wallpaper tinting, etc.).\n- External API calls or database interactions (unless they are essential for the core functionality of the component).\n\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThe user wants to extract the `AppearanceSettings` component to reuse it in another project or part of the application. This component provides a user interface for configuring appearance-related settings such as compute environment and wallpaper tinting. Understanding how this component works is crucial for maintaining and extending the application's functionality.\n\n## Dependency Handling\n\nAs you extract, you will encounter dependencies. Handle them as follows:\n\n**NPM packages:**\nIf genuinely required, include them and note in README. If only used for one small thing, consider inlining the logic instead.\n\n**Internal code from source repo:**\n- If portable (small, self-contained utility/type/hook): Copy it over with a comment noting origin (e.g., `// Ported from: src/utils/shapes.ts`)\n- If not portable (deeply entangled): Mock it with hardcoded values or fixture data\n- In both cases, do these in a seperate folder/file inside the working dir (\"extracted\")\n\n**Databases / APIs / Auth / External services:**\nAlways mock. Use hardcoded fixture data. Never require actual infrastructure.\nExample: Instead of database query, use `const MOCK_DATA = [...]`\nExample: Instead of auth, use `const CURRENT_USER = { id: \"user_1\", name: \"Demo User\" }`\n\n**State management:**\nSimplify to React useState/useReducer unless state management IS the pattern being extracted.\n\n## Output Requirements\n\nThe code example must be:\n1. **Runnable** — Works in a Next.js 14 app (app router)\n2. **Isolated** — No imports from source codebase\n3. **Minimal** — Only code necessary to demonstrate the requirement\n4. **Clear** — A developer understands the pattern in <5 minutes\n\n## README.md Must Include\n\n# [Requirement Title]\n\n## What this demonstrates\n[One paragraph explanation]\n\n## Original implementation\n[Brief description of how source repo did it]\n\nKey files from source:\n- [file path] — [what it did]\n- [file path] — [what it did]\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### NPM packages required\n- [package] — [why needed]\n\n### Code ported from source\n- [util name] from [original path] — [description]\n\n### Mocked in this example\n- [what was mocked] — [how it was mocked]\n\n## How to use\n[Any setup or usage instructions]\n\n---\n\nExecute: Analyze the source, extract relevant code, handle dependencies as encountered, produce the code example.",
