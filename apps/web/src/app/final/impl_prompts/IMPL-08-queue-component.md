# Implementation Task: QueueComponent

We are working on `@apps/web/src/app/final`

Note that many of the components are placeholders that need to be implemented.

You have a **GOLDEN EXAMPLE** of solution code located at:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/queue-component`

Pay **SPECIAL ATTENTION** to the implementation guide:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/queue-component/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

This guide defines exactly how to build this feature.

## Your Task

Please update the placeholder component at:
`apps/web/src/app/final/components/working-queue-page/queue-component.tsx`

Using the example code and following the implementation guide!

## What to Implement

- Fetch jobs with status "pending" or "claimed"
- Display list of queued jobs with StatusDot indicators
- Show job name from payload
- Implement real-time updates (polling)
- Show queue position/priority
- Handle empty queue state
