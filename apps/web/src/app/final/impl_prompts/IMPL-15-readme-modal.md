# Implementation Task: ReadmeModal

We are working on `@apps/web/src/app/final`

Note that many of the components are placeholders that need to be implemented.

You have a **GOLDEN EXAMPLE** of solution code located at:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/readme-modal`

Pay **SPECIAL ATTENTION** to the integration guide:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/readme-modal/INTEGRATION.md`

This guide defines exactly how to build this feature.

## Your Task

Please update the placeholder content in:
`apps/web/src/app/final/components/pending-apps-page/readme-modal.tsx`

Using the example code and following the integration guide!

## What to Implement

- Replace placeholder content with markdown rendering
- Fetch README.md content from codeExample.path
- Render markdown with proper styling
- Add syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Handle missing README gracefully
