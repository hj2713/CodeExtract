# Implementation Task: FileSystemModal

We are working on `@apps/web/src/app/final`

Note that many of the components are placeholders that need to be implemented.

You have a **GOLDEN EXAMPLE** of solution code located at:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/filesystem-modal`

Pay **SPECIAL ATTENTION** to the integration guide:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/filesystem-modal/INTEGRATION.md`

This guide defines exactly how to build this feature.

## Your Task

## What to Implement
