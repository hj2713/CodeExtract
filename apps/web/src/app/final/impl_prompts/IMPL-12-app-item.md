# Implementation Task: AppItem

We are working on `@apps/web/src/app/final`

Note that many of the components are placeholders that need to be implemented.

You have a **GOLDEN EXAMPLE** of solution code located at:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/app-item`

Pay **SPECIAL ATTENTION** to the implementation guide:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/app-item/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

This guide defines exactly how to build this feature.
