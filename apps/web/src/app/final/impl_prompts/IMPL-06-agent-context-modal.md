# Implementation Task: AgentContextModal

We are working on `@apps/web/src/app/final`

Note that many of the components are placeholders that need to be implemented.

You have a **GOLDEN EXAMPLE** of solution code located at:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/agent-context-modal`

**Note**: This folder does not have a dedicated guide file. Study the example code directly and apply the patterns to the /final component.

---

## Your Task

Please update the placeholder component at:
`apps/web/src/app/final/components/working-queue-page/agent-context-modal.tsx`

Using the example code as reference!

## What to Implement

- Fetch components from the selected source (source.components)
- Track multi-selection state for components
- Wire up "Add Selected" button to add context to chat
- Clear selection state on modal close
- Pass selected components to ComponentCardList
