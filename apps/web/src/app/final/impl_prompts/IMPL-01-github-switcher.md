# Implementation Task: GithubSwitcher

We are working on `@apps/web/src/app/final`

Note that many of the components are placeholders that need to be implemented.

You have a **GOLDEN EXAMPLE** of solution code located at:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/github-switcher-with-db`

Pay **SPECIAL ATTENTION** to the implementation guide:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/github-switcher-with-db/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

This guide defines exactly how to build this feature.

---

## Your Task

Please update the placeholder component at:
`apps/web/src/app/final/components/working-queue-page/github-switcher.tsx`

Using the example code and following the implementation guide!

## What to Implement

- Replace the hardcoded `DUMMY_SOURCES` array with real database fetching
- Add loading and error states
- Connect to the sources database table
- Maintain the existing dropdown UI behavior
