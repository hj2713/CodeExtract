# Implementation Task: BackNextNav

We are working on `@apps/web/src/app/final`

Note that many of the components are placeholders that need to be implemented.

You have a **GOLDEN EXAMPLE** of solution code located at:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/back-next-nav`

**Note**: This folder does not have a dedicated guide file. Study the example code directly and apply the patterns to the /final component.

---

## Your Task

Please update the component at:
`apps/web/src/app/final/components/pending-apps-page/back-next-nav.tsx`

Using the example code as reference!

## What to Implement

- Get total count of pending apps
- Disable Back button at index 0 (already done)
- Disable Next button at last item (currently missing)
- Update display to show "X of Y" format
- Consider keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
