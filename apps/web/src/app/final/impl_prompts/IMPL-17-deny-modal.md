# Implementation Task: DenyModal

We are working on `@apps/web/src/app/final`

Note that many of the components are placeholders that need to be implemented.

You have a **GOLDEN EXAMPLE** of solution code located at:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/deny-modal`

Reference the README for context:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/deny-modal/README.md`

---

## Your Task

Please update the placeholder component at:
`apps/web/src/app/final/components/pending-apps-page/deny-modal.tsx`

Using the example code as reference!

## What to Implement

- Add rejection reason selector (dropdown or radio buttons)
- Add notes textarea input
- Wire up Confirm button to update codeExample.reviewStatus
- Save rejectionReason and rejectionNotes
- Consider re-queue functionality with modified prompt
- Navigate to next pending app after denial
