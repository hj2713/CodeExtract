# Implementation Task: ButtonStack Imports

We are working on `@apps/web/src/app/final`

Note that many of the components are placeholders that need to be implemented.

**Note**: There is no dedicated golden example for the Imports button functionality. You may reference other modal implementations for patterns:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/filesystem-modal`

---

## Your Task

Please update the component at:
`apps/web/src/app/final/components/pending-apps-page/button-stack.tsx`

## What to Implement

The Imports button currently has no click handler. Implement one of:

**Option A: Package Dependencies Modal**
- Show package.json dependencies
- List installed packages with versions

**Option B: Import Analysis Modal**
- Analyze import statements in the codebase
- Show what external modules are used

**Option C: Skip for MVP**
- If unclear, leave as-is and document for future

## Implementation Notes

This feature's purpose may need clarification. Consider asking the user what the Imports button should display before implementing.
