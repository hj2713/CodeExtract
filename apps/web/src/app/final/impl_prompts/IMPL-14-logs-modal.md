# Implementation Task: LogsModal

We are working on `@apps/web/src/app/final`

Note that many of the components are placeholders that need to be implemented.

You have a **GOLDEN EXAMPLE** of solution code located at:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/logs-modal`

Reference the README for context:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/logs-modal/README.md`

---

## Your Task

Please update the placeholder content in:
`apps/web/src/app/final/components/pending-apps-page/logs-modal.tsx`

Using the example code as reference!

## What to Implement

- Replace placeholder content with actual log display
- Fetch logs for the current pending app
- Display in scrollable, monospace format (terminal-like)
- Add auto-scroll to bottom behavior
- Consider log level color coding
- Add copy/download functionality if applicable
