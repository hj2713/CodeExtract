# Implementation Task: ChatInput

We are working on `@apps/web/src/app/final`

Note that many of the components are placeholders that need to be implemented.

You have a **GOLDEN EXAMPLE** of solution code located at:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/chat-input`

Pay **SPECIAL ATTENTION** to the implementation guide:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/chat-input/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

This guide defines exactly how to build this feature.

## Your Task

Please update the placeholder component at:
`apps/web/src/app/final/components/working-queue-page/chat-input.tsx`

Using the example code and following the implementation guide!

## What to Implement

- Replace placeholder div with actual textarea
- Add auto-resize behavior for textarea
- Implement send functionality (button click and Enter key)
- Add disabled state while sending
- Keep the plus button working (opens AgentContextModal)
- Handle Shift+Enter for newlines
