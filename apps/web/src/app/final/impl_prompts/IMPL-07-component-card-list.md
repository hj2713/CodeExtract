# Implementation Task: ComponentCardList

We are working on `@apps/web/src/app/final`

Note that many of the components are placeholders that need to be implemented.

You have a **GOLDEN EXAMPLE** of solution code located at:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/component-card-list`

Pay **SPECIAL ATTENTION** to the implementation guide:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/component-card-list/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

This guide defines exactly how to build this feature.

## Your Task

Please update the placeholder component at:
`apps/web/src/app/final/components/working-queue-page/component-card-list.tsx`

Using the example code and following the implementation guide!

## What to Implement

- Accept components array and selection handlers from parent
- Render cards for each component (name, description, filePath)
- Implement selection UI (checkbox or highlight)
- Communicate selection changes to parent (AgentContextModal)
- Style selected vs unselected states
