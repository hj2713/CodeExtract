# Implementation Task: ActiveJobComponent

We are working on `@apps/web/src/app/final`

Note that many of the components are placeholders that need to be implemented.

You have a **GOLDEN EXAMPLE** of solution code located at:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/active-job-component`

Pay **SPECIAL ATTENTION** to the implementation guide:
`@apps/web/src/app/partner/backwards/prototypes/fetch-model-and-req/created-apps/active-job-component/IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`

This guide defines exactly how to build this feature.

## Your Task

Please update the placeholder component at:
`apps/web/src/app/final/components/working-queue-page/active-job-component.tsx`

Using the example code and following the implementation guide!

## What to Implement

- Identify and display currently running job (status = "claimed")
- Stream logs/progress in real-time
- Show job details (name, progress, etc.)
- Handle empty state when no active job
- Consider cancel functionality if applicable
